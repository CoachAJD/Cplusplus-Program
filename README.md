# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- Completing a task as part of an interview process with Chada Tech. A way of showcasing my coding skills as an "audition" for the role I applied for. 
What did you do particularly well?
- I did particularly well on code execution for the clock display and menu functionality. Producing a 12- and 24- hour clock display in the correct formats as well as displaying and enabling correct menu function options in the user menu.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-  I could effectively enhance my code modularization by minimizing main() functions and working on white spaces along with adding additional comments. This will in turn enhance my efficiency and make it more legible to those reading my code.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The piece I found most challenging was coming up with the proper functions in order to provide the proper display. Resources I will be adding to my support network would be codeacademy in giving me a platform to work with in order to practice and guide me to a proper outcome.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- Skills that I will be able to utilize in projects to come will be all the newly found knowledge I was able to obtain throughout this course on combining C++ and Python along with properly utilizing it within my coding. I was also able to work on my persistence nature while gaining more patience when writing the proper code that was able to run efficiently.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Making the program better was achieved through coming up with the proper functions along with utilizing the proper namespaces that enabled me to obtain a display of the 12- hour and 24- hour clock formats. This also included my use of whitespace throughtout the coding process.

How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
  User needs are one of the first discussed among the software developer team as well as with the client. The user requirements discuss the various unambiguously by writing and documenting it to determine a perfect project path. Document known as software requirement specification is used for this purpose. This includes feasibility study, requirement gathering, software requirement specification document as well as validation for the requirements. Then the requirements are organized based on their importance. After, some conflicts are resolved and negotiations take place on features and prices. 
  User stories helps a lot in a requirement gathering process and is an informal/simple discussion like language description of one or many features of the software system. It is also part of an agile software development to get an insight into the user needs from an end user's perspective. User stories thus can be captured from the end user on the client and the developer team, which reduces the time spent on writing large documentations as well as it also saves time in developing quality software.
How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
  In order to start developing a program as a developer I should have a clear picture of what features are to be included and what to avoid. There must be a process of unambiguous requirement gathering before any kind of software development process were to even begin. Upon receiving the clients requirements, the developer can then decide which software development model is best suited for the software being developed. Examples of some software development models are:
  - iterative
  - waterfall
  - prototype
  - agile
 Some agile software development processes I hope to incorporate into my future development work are scrum, extreme programming, frequent inspection and adaptation. They are part of the major methodology which can be incorporated into an agile software devleopment process as it encourages accountability, teamwork and self-organization along with being aligned with the business approach in including the client in all of the developmental process.
What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
  To be a good team member, one must be part of an overall good sofware development team. What makes a good team member includes qualities such as:
  - Being Interactive
  - Great Communication Skills
  - Good Collaborator
  - Good Leader
  - Meets Role and Responsibilities
  - Self-Motivated
  - Goal Oriented
  - Good Analyzer and comes up with good Reasoning
