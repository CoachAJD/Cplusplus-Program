# Cplusplus-Program

Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- Completing a task as part of an interview process with Chada Tech. A way of showcasing my coding skills as an "audition" for the role I applied for. 
What did you do particularly well?
- I did particularly well on code execution for the clock display and menu functionality. Producing a 12- and 24- hour clock display in the correct formats as well as displaying and enabling correct menu function options in the user menu.
Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
-  I could effectively enhance my code modularization by minimizing main() functions and working on white spaces along with adding additional comments. This will in turn enhance my efficiency and make it more legible to those reading my code.
Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
- The piece I found most challenging was coming up with the proper functions in order to provide the proper display. Resources I will be adding to my support network would be codeacademy in giving me a platform to work with in order to practice and guide me to a proper outcome.
What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
- Skills that I will be able to utilize in projects to come will be all the newly found knowledge I was able to obtain throughout this course on combining C++ and Python along with properly utilizing it within my coding. I was also able to work on my persistence nature while gaining more patience when writing the proper code that was able to run efficiently.
How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  Making the program better was achieved through coming up with the proper functions along with utilizing the proper namespaces that enabled me to obtain a display of the 12- hour and 24- hour clock formats. This also included my use of whitespace throughtout the coding process.
